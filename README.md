# Python Data Analysis Project
## Overview
Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries that make it perfect for working with data. Two key libraries we use here are pandas and NumPy.

## Python
Python is a powerful, high-level programming language that's easy to learn and use. It is widely used in various fields, including data analysis, web development, automation, and more.

## pandas
pandas is a library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides fast and flexible tools for working with data, especially structured data like tables. With pandas, you can:

Read and write data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)
Clean and prepare your data
Perform complex data operations easily

## NumPy
NumPy is a library for numerical computing in Python. It is great for performing mathematical operations on large datasets. NumPy provides:

Support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
Mathematical functions for array operations
Tools for performing element-wise operations efficiently
